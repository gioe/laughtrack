## Scraper DB Connection

`db.get_connection()` (and `db.get_connection(autocommit=True)`) opens a psycopg2 connection with `autocommit=True` by default. Each `cur.execute()` commits immediately — no explicit `conn.commit()` is required. Use `db.get_transaction()` only when you need multi-statement atomicity.

## Prisma Migrations

`prisma migrate dev` **cannot be run locally** in this project for two reasons:
1. The local PostgreSQL database is always empty (no tables); the real data lives in Neon serverless.
2. The shadow database validation fails on migration `20260308000000_set_email_scraper_fields` which contains a data-dependent operation requiring "Gotham Comedy Club" to exist.

**Workaround for new migrations**: Write the migration SQL manually, create the migration directory under `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql`, and commit both the schema and the migration file. The migration will be applied to the real DB via `prisma migrate deploy` in the deployment environment.

## Vitest Route Tests — Mocking the rateLimit Chain

Any route test that imports a handler using `@/lib/rateLimit` will transitively
load `@/auth` → `next-auth` → `next/server` (without .js), which fails in Node ESM.
Fix by adding this mock before the route import:

```ts
vi.mock("@/lib/rateLimit", () => ({
    checkRateLimit: vi.fn(() => ({ allowed: true, limit: 100, remaining: 99, resetAt: 0 })),
    getClientIp: vi.fn(() => "127.0.0.1"),
    RATE_LIMITS: { publicRead: {}, publicReadAuth: {} },
    rateLimitHeaders: vi.fn(() => ({})),
    rateLimitResponse: vi.fn(),
}));
```

## Public GET Routes — Rate Limiting

Use `applyPublicReadRateLimit(request, "<route-prefix>")` for all public GET API routes.
It automatically grants higher limits to authenticated users (keyed by user ID) vs anonymous
callers (keyed by IP), consistent with every other public GET route in the codebase.
Do NOT call `checkRateLimit` with `RATE_LIMITS.publicRead` directly in route handlers.

Also note: when mocking `@/lib/rateLimit` in Vitest, export `applyPublicReadRateLimit` as well:
```ts
applyPublicReadRateLimit: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ allowed: true, limit: 60, remaining: 59, resetAt: 0 })),
```

## Python Test Directory Naming

Do NOT add `__init__.py` to test directories whose path segments match Python stdlib
module names (e.g., a directory named `email/` under `tests/`). pytest's rootdir-based
import mode works without `__init__.py`; adding it causes the test package to shadow
the stdlib module, producing `ModuleNotFoundError` at import time.
